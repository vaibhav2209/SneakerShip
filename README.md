# SneakerShip

Welcome to the SneakerShip Project repository! This project is aimed at creating a shoe-related mobile application for Android devices. It allows users to explore and discover various shoe styles, brands, and trends.



## Features
- **Shoe Catelog:** Browse through an extensive catalog of shoes, including images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Search:** Use the search functionality to find specific shoes by name and brand.
- **Product details:** View comprehensive information about each shoe, including available sizes, colors, materials, and customer reviews.
- **Shopping cart:** Add desired shoes to the shopping cart for easy purchase and proceed to checkout for purchasing.

## Technology Used
- Kotlin
- Retrofit 2.0
- Kotlin Flow + Coroutines
- Dagger Hilt
- Room
- MVVM
- Coil

## Assumptions
- **Data Retrieval:** The shoe data is sourced from third-party APIs, which provide data in the form of JSON, including images. In the event of a data retrieval failure, it is possible that the issue could be related to limitations or restrictions associated with the free trial version of the API.
- **Order Purchase:** Assuming that the order purchase process is successful every time the user checks out their cart, the user will be navigated to the order purchased screen.
- **Taxes and charges:** Assuming a 5% tax is levied on the total purchase of shoes.
